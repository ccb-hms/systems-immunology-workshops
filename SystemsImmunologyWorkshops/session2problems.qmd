# Practice Exercises

1. **Data in R** - 
  * Use the `class()` function on `awde` and `aw`, how does the output differ between the two?
  * Use the `summary()` function on the `awde` dataframe to find the highest fold-change in the dataset.
  * When you use the `rownames()` function on `awde`, what is the *data structure* of the output?

2. **Choosing a statistical test** - Suppose you wanted to determine whether or not a particular gene knockout had an effect on tumor growth in mice. Your collaborator has taken measurments of tumor size for 30 mice, 15 knockout and 15 control. Your collaborator wanted to make sure tumor size was properly captured, so for each mouse you have 10 diffent measurments of tumor size, relating to different dimensions and features of the tumors. What is your null hypothesis? What is your alternative hypothesis? What statistical test should you use to determine whether or not the knockout had an effect?

3. **Working with distributions** - Generate 100 instances of a Poisson(3) random variable. What is the mean? What is the variance as computed by the R function `var`?

4. **Conducting a hypothesis test** Conduct a binomial test for the following scenario: out of 1 million reads, 19 reads are mapped to a gene of interest, with the probability for mapping a read to that gene being $10^{-5}$. Are these more or less reads than we would expect to be mapped to that gene? Is the finding statistically significant?

5. **Custom Functions** - Write a function to compute the probability of having a maximum as big as `m` when looking across `n` Poisson variables with rate `lambda`.
