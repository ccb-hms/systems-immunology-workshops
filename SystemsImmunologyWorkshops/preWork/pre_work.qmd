## Install R and RStudio

Before the first session, please install R and RStudio following the instructions @sec-install.

If you already have R and RStudio installed, make sure that you have the latest versions installed (you can do this by simply following the installation instructions). While this will likely not cause an issue for the first few sessions, it will in later sessions when we use more advanced packages and software.

If you encounter issues installing R or RStudio, please reach out to `christopher_magnano@hms.harvard.edu` or one of the TAs. If we are unable to resolve your issue via email, we ask that you come 30 minutes early to the first session.

## Familiarize yourself with RStudio

If you have never used RStudio or are completely new to programming, please review @sec-rstudio. This material will introduce you to the RStudio interface and how to assign values to variables in R.
