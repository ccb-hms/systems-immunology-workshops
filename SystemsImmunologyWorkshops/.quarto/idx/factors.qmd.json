Let's take a slight detour and learn about how to **relevel categories within a factor**. \n\nTo view the integer assignments under the hood you can use `str()`:\n\n```{r}\nexpression\n```\nThe categories are referred to as \"factor levels\". As we learned earlier, the levels in the `expression` factor were assigned integers alphabetically, with high=1, low=2, medium=3. However, it makes more sense for us if low=1, medium=2 and high=3, i.e. it makes sense for us to \"relevel\" the categories in this factor.\n\nTo relevel the categories, you can add the `levels` argument to the `factor()` function, and give it a vector with the categories listed in the required order:\n\n```{r}\nexpression <- factor(expression, levels=c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"))     # you can re-factor a factor \n```\n\nNow we have a releveled factor with low as the lowest or first category, medium as the second and high as the third. This is reflected in the way they are listed in the output of `str()`, as well as in the numbering of which category is where in the factor.\n\n> Note: Releveling becomes necessary when you need a specific category in a factor to be the \"base\" category, i.e. category that is equal to 1. One example would be if you need the \"control\" to be the \"base\" in a given RNA-seq experiment."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"factors.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"factors.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
